{-| A Deque (double-ended queue) in Elm.

A deque is a data type for which elements can be efficiently added or removed from either the front or the back.

Internally, this is a head-tail linked list, modeled after this [deque in Haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dequeue-0.1.12/docs/Data-Dequeue.html) which
in turn is based on Chris Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures. A head-tail linked list is based on two lists: one for the head and one for the tail.
This means that pop and push on either side are operations on the front portion of an elm list, which is very efficient (`O(1)`).

The deque rebalances (moves elements from the front to the rear or vice versa) when either one
is 4 times as large as the other. This is a costly operation and therefore used as little as possible.

For a deque with a limited size, see [BoundedDeque](#BoundedDeque).
